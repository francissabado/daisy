abstract={For the vast majority of VLSI-based electronic systems, including most of the computer and telecommunication products, low power consumption has been close to last in the list of specifications. Technology improvements and design cleverness have been devoted mostly to reaching higher speed and higher precision. In recent years, there has been a sudden change driven mainly by an urgent need for portability, but also by concerns about the growing relative cost of power supplies and of heat removal systems and  even about limits of power available from the local network. It has now become necessary to build new products with at least the same performance in speed and dynamic range, but with stringent requirements on low power. This raises questions about the limits and how they can be approached},

abstract={ Analog design in deep sub-micron technologies is a reality now and poses severe challenges to the circuit designer. Trends in technologies as well as circuit design are discussed. It is shown that the power required for a certain dynamic range and bandwidth decreases with minimum feature size as long as a constant ratio between signal swing and supply voltage can be maintained. Below 0.1Âµm channel-length, predictions of the threshold voltage endanger that requirement however. At circuit level, the problem that a low supply voltage poses on the use of switches and amplifiers is discussed. Various techniques are discussed to overcome these problems, like the use of low Vthtransistors, clock boosting, switched OpAmp technique, rail-to-rail input stages, back-gate driving circuits and CM level-shift techniques. Based on power estimates, the necessity of matching enhancing techniques like Auto-Zero techniques and Averaging is shown.},

abstract={ Modern and future ultra-deep-submicron (UDSM) technologies introduce several new problems in analog design. Nonlinear output conductance in combination with reduced voltage gain pose limits in linearity of (feedback) circuits. Gate-leakage mismatch exceeds conventional matching tolerances. Increasing area does not improve matching any more, except if higher power consumption is accepted or if active cancellation techniques are used. Another issue is the drop in supply voltages. Operating critical parts at higher supply voltages by exploiting combinations of thin- and thick-oxide transistors can solve this problem. Composite transistors are presented to solve this problem in a practical way. Practical rules of thumb based on measurements are derived for the above phenomena.},

abstract={This paper discusses optimizations for the power dissipation of RF front ends in portable wireless devices. A breakthrough in power dissipation can be achieved by simultaneously optimizing the antenna interface, circuits and  IC technology of such devices. A model that predicts the minimum power dissipation of a front end for both short-range and long-range connections will be introduced. Using these models, the impact of the antenna interface on the power dissipation will be assessed. Using two antennas with equal gain combining, a typical power dissipation reduction of 2.5 to 30 times can be achieved. Using high-impedance circuits for short-range systems in combination with silicon-on-anything technology, a further reduction of power dissipation by up to one order of magnitude can be realized},

abstract={A very important limitation of high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is their power dissipation. ADC power dissipation has been examined several times, mostly empirically. In this paper, we present an attempt to estimate a lower bound for the power of ADCs, based on first principles and using pipeline and flash architectures as examples. We find that power dissipation of high-resolution ADCs is bound by noise, whereas technology is the limiting factor for low-resolution devices. Our model assumes the use of digital error correction, but we also study an example on the power penalty due to matching requirements. A comparison with published experimental data indicates that the best ADCs use about 50 times the estimated minimum power. Two published ADCs are used for a more detailed comparison between the minimum bound and today's designs.},

abstract={The limits of the noise performance of detector readout front ends in CMOS technology have been studied. A theoretical minimal number of equivalent noise charge (ENC) that can be achieved by a CMOS technology is derived, taking both thermal noise and 1/f noise into account. Design criteria and techniques of CMOS readout front ends are presented so as to fully exploit the maximal capability of a CMOS technology. The optimal input transistor dimensions and bias conditions of charge sensitive amplifiers (CSA) are analytically determined. For readout front ends using semi-Gaussian pulse shapers, the optimal number of integrators and the optimal peaking time are determined from the point of view of achieving the best detector resolution. In order to verify the theoretical analyses, a charge sensitive amplifier and a fourth-order semi-Gaussian pulse shaper with 1-\u03bcs peaking time have been designed in a standard 3-\u03bcm CMOS technology. Calculations and computer simulations show that by optimal design of input CSA and semi-Gaussian pulse shaper, a detector resolution as low as 600 equivalent noise electrons can be obtained for a 40-pF detector capacitance},

abstract={A general model is introduced which is capable of making accurate, quantitative predictions about the phase noise of different types of electrical oscillators by acknowledging the true periodically time-varying nature of all oscillators. This new approach also elucidates several previously unknown design criteria for reducing close-in phase noise by identifying the mechanisms by which intrinsic device noise and external noise sources contribute to the total phase noise. In particular, it explains the details of how 1/f noise in a device upconverts into close-in phase noise and identifies methods to suppress this upconversion. The theory also naturally accommodates cyclostationary noise sources, leading to additional important design insights. The model reduces to previously available phase noise models as special cases. Excellent agreement among theory, simulations and  measurements is observed},

Systematic design of fully integrated LC-VCOs with a high inductance tank leads to a cross-coupled double core LC-VCO as the optimal solution in terms of power consumption.

The concepts are verified with a 0.25-\u03bcm standard CMOS fully integrated quadrature VCO for zero- or low-IF DCS1800, DECT, or GSM receivers. At 2.5-V power supply voltage and a total power dissipation of 20 mW, the quadrature VCO features a worst-case phase noise of -143 dBc/Hz at 3-MHz frequency offset over the tuning range.

abstract={A passive RC bandpass filter (BPF) based voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) operating at 2.5 GHz is presented. In GHz frequency range, a preferred type of an oscillator is either an LC oscillator or a ring oscillator. An LC oscillator exhibits an excellent phase noise performance while its fabrication cost is expensive due to the inductors. On the other hand, a ring oscillator can be built with standard CMOS devices resulting in a cheap fabrication cost. However, it has a poor phase noise and jitter performance and is sensitive to power supply noise. This paper proposes a RC BPF-based oscillator. Its property is closer to a LC oscillator rather than a ring oscillator and, as a result, improves the jitter performance due to power supply noise. Also, it can be fabricated in a standard CMOS process since there is no inductor. To prove the proposed concept, a RC BPF-based oscillator was designed and fabricated in a standard 0.13-mum CMOS technology. An operating frequency of 2.5 GHz and phase noise of - 95.4 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset was measured. Power consumption was 2.86 mW from a 1.3 V supply voltage.},
