	function [D] = bpmf_d_func(Z,NIN,NZ,q,z0_sqred)	%  	% Calculates the D value in the Z_frequency 	% point z0_sqred. The D function is used for finding 	% arc minimums for the bandpass maximally flat filter case. 	% Other input arguments are the number of attenuation 	% poles at infinity NIN, the number of attenuation poles 	% at the origin NZ, the passband quotient q = wb/wa and 	% the attenuation pole vector Z.		% Author: 			Per Loewenborg    % Modified by:		LW	% Copyright:		Divison of Electronics Systems	%					Dept.
