This code is written explicitly for converting MATLAB 4.2's Adobe
Illustrator output into Frame MIF (Maker Interchange Format).
This allows MATLAB graphics to be imported into Frame.  The resulting
importing graphic is then EDITABLE in Frame.


USAGE:
-----
This programs is very simple to use.  I found it easiest to create an
M-file in MATLAB that generates a MIF file automatically.  Such a M-file
is given below.

   function printmif(arg1)
   %PRINT  Print graph to an Adobe Illustrator file then use
   %       AI2MIF to convert it to FrameMaker MIF format.
   %
   ai2mifpath='c:\cpp\programs\ai2mif';    % Insert appropriate path here
   %
   temp=cd;                                % Get the current directory
   tmp=['print -dill ' arg1 '.ai'];
   eval(tmp);                              % Print to an AI file
   tmp=[ai2mifpath temp '\' arg1 '.ai ' temp '\' arg1 '.mif > NUL |'];
   eval(['!' tmp]);                        % Execute AI2MIF in background
   delete([temp '\' arg1 '.ai']);          % Delete the AI file
   end

Otherwise the program can be used manually from the DOS prompt as follows.

   ai2mif infile {outfile}

The program creates a file named "default.mif" if the "outfile" parameter
is not specified.


NOTES:
-----
1) This code is a quick and somewhat dirty solution to the problem of
importing MATLAB graphics.  The code should support any MATLAB "line"
graphic.  This includes any 2D, 3D, mesh and contour plots consisting only
of lines and text.  However any SURFACE or BITMAPS graphics are not
supported.

2) The code contains almost no error checking so use it at your own risk.

3) I am quite certain that this code will NOT WORK with anything other than
a MATLAB AI file.  I wrote the program by deciphering the symbol meanings
from a number of MATLAB outputs.  I had no references to the TRUE AI format.

4) Object clipping is rather crudely implemented.  This keeps graphs from
exceeding their axis edges.  However I have not accounted for a few unlikely
possibilities.

5) Matlab plots using NON-SOLID linetypes (dashed, dotted, etc.) which have
a LARGE number of points will appear solid in FRAME.  You can fix this by
ungrouping the graphic after it is imported and using the Frame SMOOTH
command on the individual traces.  Frame seems to display the linetype
correctly when the POLYLINE is smoothed.

6) You will notice that if you SCALE the graphic once imported into Frame
the text size will not scale with it.  This is annoying but I don't know a
way around it.  You can easily scale the text manually using the "character
designer" menu.

7) All colors are mapped to Frame BLACK or NONE.  Color support would not
be to bad to add but I have no need for it.
