	function [h, ah] = HURWITZ_POLY(Poly)	%	% 	Factorizes a polynomial into a Hurwitz and an anti-Hurwitz polynomial	%	without any roots solving. Poly must be an even polynomial with every 	%	other coefficient equal to zero.	%	% 	Toolbox for ANALOG FILTERS USING MATLAB, Springer, 2009			%	Author: 			Lars Wanhammar 2007-08-28						%	Modified by: 	%	Copyright:			Divison of Electronics Systems	%	 					Dept.
