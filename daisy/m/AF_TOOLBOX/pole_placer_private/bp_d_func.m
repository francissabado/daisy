	function [D] = bp_d_func(Z,NIN,NZ,q,z0_sqred)	%  	% Calculates the D value in the Z_frequency point z0_sqred. 	% The D function is used for finding arc minimums for the 	% lowpass filter case. 	% Other input arguments are the number of attenuation poles 	% at infinity NIN, the number of attenuation poles at the origin,	% the passband quotient q = wb/wa and the attenuation pole vector Z.	% 	% Author: 			Per Loewenborg    % Modified by:		LW	% Copyright:		Divison of Electronics Systems	%					Dept.
