	function [Asave, Bsave] = bairstow(A)	% 	% Extracts factors of the form x^4 + aix^2 +bi	% out of a polynomial A = E*conj(E).	% The output is the vectors Asave and Bsave on the form [a0 a1 ..] and	% [b0 b1 ...] respectively. The function uses matlab functions for factorization.	% If there is a real factor, then the corresponding ai is set to inf to show this.		% Author: 			Per Loewenborg    % Modified by:		Lw	% Copyright:		Divison of Electronics Systems	%					Dept.
